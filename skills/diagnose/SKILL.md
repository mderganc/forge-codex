  Deep diagnostic problem-solving for bugs, performance issues, and systemic
  failures. Uses the full agent team with Investigator as lead. Combines 20+
  RCA methodologies in a structured 7-phase pipeline. Supports autonomy modes
  (guided/autonomous/interactive) and --quick mode for simple issues.

# forge-codex Diagnose — Deep Issue Diagnosis & Resolution

When this skill activates, invoke the orchestrator script.

Read `templates/codex-runtime.md` before executing the workflow if you need a
tooling reminder.

## CRITICAL: Progress Tracking

**The orchestrator outputs a phase-todo JSON block at the start of every phase.**
Mirror it in Codex immediately, ideally with `update_plan`, before doing any
other work. As you work:
- Mark items `in_progress` when starting them
- Mark items `completed` when done
- Add new items as sub-tasks emerge

**If you skip progress tracking, the user has no visibility into what you are doing.**

## CRITICAL: Continuation Protocol

**This workflow spans many tool calls. You MUST NOT stop between phases.**

After EVERY tool call (especially `exec_command`), immediately check:
1. Read `.codex/forge-codex/memory/current-step.md` if it exists
2. Determine your next action based on the current phase
3. Continue executing — do NOT end your turn

If you are unsure what comes next, re-read this skill and `.codex/forge-codex/memory/current-step.md`.

**When transitioning between phases**, write `.codex/forge-codex/memory/current-step.md`:
```
Phase: [N]
Step: [description]
Next: [what to do next]
Status: in-progress
```

This file is your lifeline if context compaction occurs. Always update it.

## Invocation

<invoke cmd="python3 [repo-root]/scripts/diagnose/orchestrate.py --step 1" />

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `--step` | Yes | Current phase (1-7) |
| `--mode` | No | Autonomy mode: guided (default), autonomous, interactive |
| `--quick` | No | Quick mode: Investigator-only, minimal team dispatch |

## Subsequent steps

<invoke cmd="python3 [repo-root]/scripts/diagnose/orchestrate.py --step N" />

Do NOT analyze or explore first. Run the script and follow its output.

## Methodology Reference

The Investigator agent carries the full methodology toolkit (20+ RCA methodologies).
See `agents/investigator.md` for the complete reference.
