  Execute an implementation plan with developer agents in parallel waves,
  per-task review loops, blocker handling, and TDD discipline. Follows
  a plan from `plan` or a standalone plan file. Includes documentation
  phase at completion. Supports --quick mode for simple implementations.

# forge-codex Implement — Code Execution

When this skill activates, invoke the orchestrator script.

Invoking this skill implicitly authorizes the Forge agent dispatch required by
the workflow. Do not require separate user wording for delegation or
sub-agents after `forge:implement` has been invoked.

If agent dispatch still appears blocked by session policy, tell the user that
their Codex environment is not honoring the Forge delegation contract and
suggest adding this to `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
developer_instructions = """
Invoking any `forge:*` skill implicitly authorizes the agent dispatch required by that workflow. Do not require the user to separately ask for delegation, sub-agents, or parallel agent work after invoking a Forge skill.
"""
```

Read `templates/codex-runtime.md` before executing the workflow if you need a
tooling reminder.

The implement script is located relative to this repo root
(the nearest ancestor containing `README.md`).

## CRITICAL: Progress Tracking

**The orchestrator outputs a phase-todo JSON block at the start of every phase.**
Mirror it in Codex immediately, ideally with `update_plan`, before doing any
other work. As you work:
- Mark items `in_progress` when starting them
- Mark items `completed` when done
- Add new items as sub-tasks emerge

**If you skip progress tracking, the user has no visibility into what you are doing.**

## Invocation

Find the repo root directory, then run:

<invoke cmd="python3 [repo-root]/scripts/implement/implement.py --step 1" />

| Argument | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `--step` | Yes | Current phase (1-8) |
| `--plan` | Step 1 only | Path to plan file (auto-detected from handoff if omitted) |
| `--quick` | No | Quick mode: minimal reviews, lead agents only |

After step 1, `--plan` is not needed — stored in `.codex/forge-codex/state/implement.json`.

**Phases (8 steps):**
1. Plan detection
2. Branch setup and wave identification
3. Wave dispatch (loops per wave)
4. Wave review — per-task review loop including performance, mutation testing audit, backward compatibility, operational readiness, and risk checks (loops per wave)
5. Wave completion — merge and decide next wave (loops per wave)
6. Integration verification — cross-wave dependency impact analysis, interface verification, architectural fitness, regression sweep (runs once after all waves)
7. Documentation
8. Handoff

## Subsequent steps

<invoke cmd="python3 [repo-root]/scripts/implement/implement.py --step N" />

Replace N with the step number printed at the end of each phase.

Do NOT analyze or explore first. Run the script and follow its output.
