# Full Team Review — Dispatch

Dispatch the full review team to analyze the current implementation.

## Team Assignments

All reviewers operate against the current feature branch in parallel:

| Agent | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| **Architect** | Architecture conformance — does code match plan? Component boundaries? Drift? |
| **QA Reviewer** | Full test suite + coverage. Edge cases. Integration. Requirements verification. |
| **Security Reviewer** | OWASP audit. Input validation. Auth/authz. Dependencies. Secrets. |
| **Critic** | Most likely production failure? What wasn't tested? What assumption was wrong? |
| **Investigator** | Deep-dive on any areas flagged by other reviewers. |

## Instructions

1. Dispatch all reviewers in parallel
2. Each reviewer writes findings to their memory file
3. Use finding format from `templates/review-loop.md`
4. Each finding needs: ID, severity (PASS/WARN/FAIL), location, description, impact, fix
