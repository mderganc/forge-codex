# Codex Runtime Conventions

Use these conventions whenever forge-codex instructions mention generic actions like
reading files, editing code, tracking progress, or asking the user questions.

## Tool Mapping

- Progress tracking:
  Use `update_plan` for visible progress. Translate phase todos into plan steps
  with `pending`, `in_progress`, and `completed`.

- User questions:
  Ask the user directly in plain text by default.
  In Plan mode, `request_user_input` may be used if a structured picker is
  explicitly helpful, but forge-codex must not depend on it.

- File reading and search:
  Prefer `exec_command` with:
  - `rg` for text search
  - `rg --files` or `find` for file discovery
  - `sed -n`, `cat`, or similar for file reads

- File edits:
  Prefer `apply_patch` for manual edits.
  Use `exec_command` only for non-patch operations such as formatting, tests,
  git inspection, or running helper scripts.

- Multi-step shell work:
  Use `exec_command` and, if needed, `write_stdin` for interactive follow-up.

- Parallel work:
  Use `spawn_agent` only when delegation is explicitly allowed and the task is
  well-scoped. Coordinate with `send_input`, `wait_agent`, and `close_agent`.

## Prompt Writing Rules

- When a template says "read", interpret that as "inspect with Codex tools",
  usually via `exec_command`.
- When a template says "write", interpret that as "edit or create files with
  Codex tools", usually via `apply_patch`.
- When a template says "search", interpret that as `rg` unless a different tool
  is clearly better.
- When a template says "ask the user", keep it to one concise question unless
  multiple questions are truly necessary.

## Agent Guidance

- Do not assume assistant-specific tools or slash commands exist.
- Prefer concrete Codex tool names in instructions when ambiguity would hurt.
- If a workflow boundary requires user approval, pause and ask directly instead
  of inventing a structured UI dependency.
